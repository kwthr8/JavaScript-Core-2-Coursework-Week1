/** 

The Recipe Card
Never forget another recipe!

Create an object to hold information on your favorite recipe. 

It should have properties for 

- Title (a string), 
- Servings (a number), and 
- Ingredients (an array of strings)

On separate lines (one console.log statement for each), log the recipe information so it looks like:

Mole
Serves: 2
Ingredients:
cinnamon
cumin
cocoa

You should write and log at least 5 recipes

**/
let recipe {
    title: "Mole",
    serves: 4,
    food: "cin, cumin, cocoa";
} 
    recipe(obj){ 
     
  return obj.title + "<br>" + "serves: " +  obj.serves + "<br>" + "ingredients: <br>" + obj.food + " <br> " 
      }
};
